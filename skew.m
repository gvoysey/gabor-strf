% SKEW: Determination of Temporal Skew.  [T] = skew(trf) returns the skewed
%        temporal axis to provide a better fit for gabor models.
%        Physiologically this accounts for differences in neuron onset/offset
%        times which skew the temporal profile and make it harder to fit it with
%        gabor functions.
