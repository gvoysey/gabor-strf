% ASYMMETRY: Temporal Asymmetry Index
%            [alpha_t] = ASYMMETRY(trf)  returns the asymmetry index of a
%            given temporal response profile. Indicies of 0 indicate no skew,
%            negative indicies indicate a right-handed skew, and positive
%            indicate a left-handed skew.
